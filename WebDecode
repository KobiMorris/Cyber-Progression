This is notes and steps taken to attempt/complete the 'WebDecode' challenge on play.picoctf.org

Presented with the homepage, being that this is about the web-inspector, I opened it (Mozilla) and went to the furthest right that would contain data, this was 'Storage'. It contained no data at all. 

Moved to Network -> Reload -> Investigated each one -> Nothing

Moved to inspector -> Expand all -> Nothing 'unusual'

Moved to next page 'About'

Followed the same routine. Nothing out of oridnary untile the inspector.

This is where I noticed a long string of gibberish within the section header "<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9">

Following from what was the previous objective 'Cookie Monster Secter Recipe', I tried to decode it using the base64 decode method which was a success, leaving the flag -> 

picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_df0da727}

Didn't Cheat :)

No Mistakes or anything to learn from in this objective. I had prior html experience.
